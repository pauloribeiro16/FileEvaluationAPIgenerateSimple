Analysis Mode Logged As: Raw JSON Analysis

INPUT TO LLM:
--------------- System Prompt ---------------
You are an expert data protection assistant. Your task is to provide an overall PII sensitivity assessment for an entire JSON document provided to you as a raw JSON string.

Analyze the entire JSON content. Determine if the document, as a whole, is likely to contain significant personal data, some personal data, or primarily non-personal data according to GDPR principles.

Focus on identifying if direct identifiers (like full name, email address, social security number, physical address, phone number), indirect identifiers (like user ID, IP address, cookie ID), or special categories of data (health, financial, precise geolocation, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data) are present within the JSON structure and its values.

**IMPORTANT: Provide your response as plain text only. Do NOT use any Markdown formatting such as headings (e.g., #, ##), lists (e.g., *, -), bolding (e.g., **, __), italics (e.g., *, _), or code blocks (e.g., ```). Your entire output should be a single block of natural language paragraphs.**
--------------- User Prompt ---------------
Please provide an overall PII sensitivity assessment for the document named 'GtfsAccessPoint.json'.
The raw JSON content of the document is as follows:

{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "$schemaVersion": "0.0.1",
  "modelTags": "",
  "$id": "https://smart-data-models.github.io/dataModel.UrbanMobility/GtfsAccessPoint/schema.json",
  "title": "Smart Data Models. GTFS Schema",
  "description": "GTFS Access Point",
  "type": "object",
  "allOf": [
    {
      "$ref": "https://smart-data-models.github.io/data-models/common-schema.json#/definitions/GSMA-Commons"
    },
    {
      "$ref": "https://smart-data-models.github.io/data-models/common-schema.json#/definitions/Location-Commons"
    },
    {
      "$ref": "https://smart-data-models.github.io/dataModel.UrbanMobility/gtfs-schema.json#/definitions/GTFS-Stop-Commons"
    },
    {
      "properties": {
        "type": {
          "type": "string",
          "enum": [
            "GtfsAccessPoint"
          ],
          "description": "Property. NGSI Entity Type: It has to be GtfsAccessPoint"
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "required": [
    "id",
    "type",
    "name",
    "location"
  ]
}

Provide your assessment in clear, concise natural language paragraphs.
Explain your reasoning, highlighting any key JSON paths or values that lead to your conclusion.
If the document contains multiple types of sensitive data, or data that becomes sensitive when combined, please mention that.
Conclude with a clear overall assessment statement (e.g., "Overall, this document has a high potential for containing sensitive personal data because...", or "Overall, this document appears to contain primarily non-personal metadata...", or "Overall, this document contains a moderate level of personal data due to...").

**Format instructions:**
- Your entire response must be plain text.
- Do not use Markdown formatting (no headings, no lists, no bold/italics, no code blocks).
- Present the assessment as a continuous block of text, structured in natural language paragraphs.
